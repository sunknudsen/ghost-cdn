# ghost-cdn

## Deliver content on Ghost.

[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is an amazing open source publication platform used by content creators to monetize their content.

Delivering content (such as adaptive video streams and large files) is not currently possible on Ghost so I created ghost-cdn to scratch my own itch.

Implementing ghost-cdn it not straightforward… this repo was made public so other technologists don’t have to go down the rabbit hole like I did.
